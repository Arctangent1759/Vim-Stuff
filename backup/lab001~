Discussion is worth 10%
	-No points IFF don't come and failing
	-COME TO LABS

Course is easy until Ch21: Electromechanics

==========================================

			 Math Concepts

==========================================

Basic Integration (1b trig sub)

Vectors
	-ai+bj+ck
	-(ax,ay,az)
	-[ax,ay,az] (column form) (best form, easy to add, easy to dot)

Law of Cosines

Volume and Surface Integrals
	-Divergence Theorem
	-Stoke's Theorem

==========================================

			Maxwell's Equations

==========================================

B is magnetic field
E is electrical field

Divergence(B) = 0
Divergence(E) = 4 pi p
Curl(E)=-1/C dB/dt
Curl(B)=-1/C dE/dt

Break down when very small
