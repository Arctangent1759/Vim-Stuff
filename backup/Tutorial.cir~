* We are building this circuit:
* -----vvv-----
* |    R1=1k  |
* |           |
* +V1=5       >
* -      R2=1k>
* |           >
* |           |

* -------------

*Create a 5V DC voltage source between nodes 0(-) and 1(+). All Voltage sources must be named with a V at the back.
V1 1 0 DC 5

*Create a 1000 Ohm resistor
R1 1 2 1k

*Create a 1000 ohm resistor
R2 2 0 1000

*Analyze output, spit out output.

*The last line is always .End
