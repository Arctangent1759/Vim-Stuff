We aim to help filter and categorize the internship opportunities so that we could help match them up with the fit ones. Our target club members are mainly freshman and sophomore because itâ€™s harder for them to find internships. What we do it that we contact companies (local) to have their ppl come over talk about their companies and what kind interns they are looking, after that, they can submit their resumes, and further talk to the recruiters about the work. For international companies, we would also try to have the companies, which have local branch to come over to talk about it. Otherwise, we will post the application info on our website. By doing this, we are making it a lot easier for them to see through the information.
