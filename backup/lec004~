Fourier Series Review
=====================
	Recap: x(t) periodic period p
	x(t)=A_0+\sum_(k=1)^\infinity A_k cos(kw_0t+\phi_k)

	Can be used to turn a nonperiodic signal over a finite range and turn it into a periodic Fourier Series.

	Application: Siri
		Divide the voice signal into a series of 100ms phenomes, and try to understand what they say

	Application: Stock market
		Frequencies have significance. High frequencies mean the stock volitility is high, while low frequencies mean stock volitility is low.
		This allows traders to predict stock market forces.
		Filter out high frequencies to see long term behavior of stock.
	
	Frequency Histogram
	-------------------
		Plot A_k with respect to k. This shows which frequencies are most influential. High k (high frequences) tend to have less influence.

Discrete-time signals
=====================
	x(n), n \in \integers
	\_Samples\_ of a continuous time signal

	A discrete time sinusoid:
	x(n)=cos(2\pi fn), n \in \integers

	A discrete sample of x(n)=cos(2\pi n) has points at the maxima of the sinusoid.
	A discrete sample of x(n)=cos(2\pi (1/2)n) has points at the maxima and minima of the sinusoid.
	A discrete sample of x(n)=cos(2\pi (1/3)n) has points at the maxima and two points on the dip of the sinusoid.

	p=1/f? No! Try a discrete time sample of x(n)=cos(2/pi (2)n).
		-Suppose f is irrational.
		-Objective: x(n)=cos(2\pi fn) = cos(2\pi f(n+p))=cos(2\pi fn+2\pi fp)
		-Since there's no 2\pi fp equal to 2\pi fn, x(n) is NOT PERIODIC
		-Suppose f = a/b => p=b

	For discrete time-signals, the frequency of the signal is limited, even if the frequency of the sampled continuous signal increases.
	For example, sampling the f=1 signal and the f=2 bothh yielded a discrete time signal of 1,1,1,1,1...

	x(t)=cos(2\pi f_c t), f_c=400Hz. 
	Sample at 8000 samples/second
	What is the frequency f_d of the discrete time sinusoid? f_d measured in samples^(-1)
	f_d=(400Hz)/(8000 Samples/s) = .05 per sample
	Significance? For every sample, .05 of the period is traversed.

Discrete Fourier Series
=======================
	x(n) period p
	Then x(n)=A_0 + \sum_(k=1)^K A_k cos(k\omega_0n+\phi_k), \omega_0=2\pi /p
	K = p/2 if p is even, (p-1)/2 if p is odd
	EXACT! 100% ACCURACY!

	To evaluate over a period:
	x(n)=A_0 + \sum_(k=1)^K A_k cos(k\omega_0n+\phi_k), \omega_0=2\pi /p, n=0,1,...,p-1
		-For each N, you have an equation. (p equations)
		-A_0, A_k, and \phi_k are unknowns. 1+K*2=1+p-1=p unknowns. (p unknowns)
		-Rewrite as: x(n)=A_0 + \sum_(k=1)^K X_k cos(k\omega_0n)+ Y_k sin(k\omega_0n), \omega_0=2\pi /p, n=0,1,...,p-1
