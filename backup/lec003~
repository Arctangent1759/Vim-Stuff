Recap: Sinusoid:
===============
	x(t)=Asin(\omega t + \phi)
		\omega is in rad/s, = 2\pi f
		\phi = phase

	Digression: Is a sinusoid sin or cos? (Trigonometry Review)
		sin(A+B)=sin(A)cos(B)+sin(B)cos(A)
		x(t)=A sin(\omega t + \phi)
			=A[cos(\phi)sin(\omega t)+sin(\phi)cos(\omega t)]
		x(t)=A cos(\omega t + \phi)
		    =A[cos(\phi)cos(\omega)t-sin(\phi)sin(\omega t)]

		\_Sinusoids are linear combinations of sine and cosine!\_
		x(t)=\alpha sin(\omega t) + \beta cos(\omega t)

		x_1(t)=A_1 cos(\omega t+\phi_1)
		x_2(t)=A_2 cos(\omega t + \phi_2)
		x(t) = x_1(t)+x_2(t) = \alpha_1 sin(\omega t) + \beta_1 cos(\omega t) + \alpha_2 sin(\omega t) + \beta_2 cos(\omega t) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)sin(\omega t)+(\beta_1+\beta_2)cos(\omega t)

		So if you take one boring Sinusoid, and add another boring sinusoid of the same frequency, you get a third boring sinusoid of the same frequency that is the linear combination of the former two.

		Application: This is why wireless carriers rent different frequencies.

	x_1(t)=A_1 cos(\omega_1 t + \phi_1)
	x_2(t)=A_2 cos(\omega_2 t + \phi_2)
	...
	x_n(t)=A_n cos(\omega_n t + \phi_n)

Fourier Series:
==============
	How do you model a square wave using an infinite sum of sinusoids?

	Periodic Signal
	---------------
		Definition: 
			A \*periodic signal\* is a signal such that x(t+p)=x(t) for t \in \Reals

		w_0 <--> 2\pi f
		eg. x(t)=cos(\omega_0 t)
		p= 2\pi /\omega_0 = 1/f

		The smallest p such that  x(t+p)==x(t) \forall t is called the period of the signal.

	To model the square wave, take a sinusoid. Then take a sinusoid of a higher frequency for finer precision. Then take the limit as the \_number of sinusoids\_ approaches infinity, to get an approximation of the square wave.
	x_1(t)=A_1 cos((2\pi /p)t + \phi_1)		P
	x_2(t)=A_2 cos((2\pi*2 /p)t + \phi_2)	P/2
	x_3(t)=A_3 cos((3\pi*2 /p)t + \phi_3)	P/3

	Theorem: 
		Given almost every x(t) with period p, x(t)=A_0 + sum(k=1,\infinity,A_k cos((k 2\pi/p)t + \phi_k)
			-Does not work for signals that are not piecewise continuous.
			-...but will be true for all intensive purposes in an engineering course.
			-Gibb's Phenomenon: Fourier Series approximation is good for all points EXCEPT when there's a discontinuity. 
			-A_k gets smaller for increasing values of k. Hence, gains in precision decrease as number of sinusoids increases.
