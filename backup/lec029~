Quicksort, General
===================
	Recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm.
	Fastest comparison-based sort for arrays.

	Theta(n^2) worst-case time.

	Virtually always runs in Theta(n log n) time.

	Procedure: 
		1. Start with list I of n items.

		2. Choose pivot item v from I.

		3. Partition I into two unsorted lists I1 and I2.
			-I1: all keys smaller than v's key.
			-I2: all keys larger than v's key.
			-Items with same key as v go into either list.

		3. Pivot v does not go in either list.

		4. Sort I1 recursively, yielding sorte listS1.
		5. Sort I2 recursively, yielding sorte listS1.
		6. Concatenate S1, v, S2, yielding sorted list S

	4|7|1|5|9|3|0
	4	1|3|0	7|5|9
	4	1	0	3	7	5	9
	1	0	3	4	7	5	9

	When input is already sorted, choosing pivot to tbe the first item is disasterous: Theta(n^2)
	Solution:
		1. Choose a random pivot.
			Randomly select an item I as pivot
			On average (expected) running time \in O(n log n)
		2. Pick 2 items, take the median. Alternatively, pick n, take the median of each 2 consecutive, and take the median of medians

Qicksort on Linked Lists
========================
	Suppose we put all items w/ same key as v into I1
	5|5|5|5|5|5|5	
	5|5|5|5|5|5		5	||
	I1				v	I2
	quadratic running time!

	Better: Partition I into 3 lists I1, I2, Iv.
	Iv ocontains pivot v and all items with same key.

	5|7|5|0|6|5|5
	0	5|5|5|5	6|7
	0|5|5|5|5|6|7

Quicksort on Arrays
===================
	In-place
	Input: array a.
	Sort items from a[low]...a[high]

	Procedure:
		1. Choose pivot v.
		2. Swap with last item, a[high].
		3. Partition: i=low-1, j=high.
		4. i,j sandwich the item to be partitioned.
		5. Advance i and j forward until they cross, keeping the folowing invariants:
			-All items to or left of i must have a key <= pivot.
			-All items to or right of j must have a key >= pivot.

		 3|8|0|9|5|7|4
		^			 ^
		i			 j

		 3|8|0|9|4|7|5
		^			 ^
		i			 j

		 3|8|0|9|4|7|5
		   ^	 ^	 
		   i	 j	 

		 3|4|0|9|8|7|5
		   ^	 ^	 
		   i	 j	 

		 3|4|0|9|8|7|5
			 ^ ^	 	 
			 j i	 	 

		i and j have crossed, so stop.

	Items with same key as pivot?
	5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5
	JUST SWAP THE FUCKING FIVES WITH EACH OTHER REPEATEDLY.
	(This is dumb.)
