Lecture Goals
=============
	-Diversity, sadaptation, major themes in this course
		-Ecological, behavioral, anatomical, etc
	-General review of anatomy, primarily skeletal
	-Build a knowledge base for future lectures, many of which deal withanatomical variation
	-How can anatomy tell us about behavior?

Body Size and Shape
===================
	Morphology
	----------
		Primates retain primitive morphology
			Compare to other mammals like horses, bats, etc
		Within primate order: body can vary quite substantially, though morphological similarities
		We are medium-sized mammals

	Primate Brains
	--------------
		Big brains relative to body size
		Large memory, processing speed, solve complex problems
		20% of energy consumption of the body

		Chimpanzee brain grows until 2 and levels off

		Human brain grows for 4 years to a much larger size, then levels off

		Human brain larger than mother's pelvis causes problem during birth

	Skeletons
	---------
		Skeleton is dynamic tissue, "turns over" in 10 years

		Skeletal regions:
			Axial
			Appendicular
			Cranial and Postcranial

		Bones Types:
			Long
			Flat
			Short (cuboids)
			Irregular
			Cortical and Trabecular

		Bone function
			Bones to know: Feagle pg 11, figure 2.3 Feagle 2.21 pg. 22

			Structural
				Framework, protection, movement
			Physiological
				Resevoir for marrow, for generating blood cells
				Stores Ca and Ph for use in body
			Composition
				1/3 organic (collagin) 2/3 inorganic (hydroxapatite). 
				Organic tissue provides elasticity.

			Cranium
				Cranium formed by many bones fused together
				Exception: Ear ossicles
				The mandible is normally 2 bone, doesn't fuse for some primates.
				Regions: Face (splanchocranium) nad braincase(Neurocranium)

				Protection for brain, eyes, ears
				Scaffolding for chewing
				Functions can compete for space
				Cranial morphology highly important in fossil reconstructions:

				Large Canine Tooth indicator of Intermale competition

				Large Sagital Crest (large anchor point on top of skull) indicative of strong chewing, due to need of muscle anchor points

		Hands and Feet
			Bones reveal a great amount of information on behavior

		Pelvis
			Useful for sex determination--femalses have larger pelvises, and possibly a larger opening
			Leg muscle differences between us nad quadripeds; chompanzees focus on extension, while we focus on abducion/reetraction
			Abductors help distribute weight.
			Knee locking allow standing without muscle strain.

		Limb proportions
			Lengths--(humerus+radius)/(femur+tibia)*100 (Essentially arm-to-length-ratio)
			Leapers--70
			Suspensory--100
			Quadraped-100
			Humans--70

		Teeth:
			Evolved from fish scales
			Evolved seperately from jaws
			Heterodont teeth are ancestral (plesiomorphic) state for vertebrates
			Most mammals are heterodont; toothed whales, dolphins, porpoises, and armadillos excepted.
			Determine diet

			Enamel -- 95% inorganic, nonvascular coating with no remodeling (doesn't regenerate)
			Dentine--Bone like substance
				Calcified tissue: 80% inorganic
				Harder than bone
				Living cells called ondontoblasts

			Dental orientation
				Labial (towards lips) vs Lingual (towards tongue)
				Buccal (towards cheek)
				Mesial (front)
				Distal (back)
				Occlusal (chewing surface)
				Incisive (chewing surface of incisor)
				Interproximal (between the teeth)

			Number of teeth of each class forms the dental formula
				I--Incisor
				C--Canine
				PM--Premolar
				M--Molars
			Adult: 2:1:2:3 (I:C:PM:M)
			Child: 2:1:2 (i:c:m)

			Teeth are extremely informative about the individual
			Metric Traits
				Metric features like dimensions, enamel thickness
			Nonmetric traits
				Subjective features like "shoveling", the curving geometry of asian teeth

			SEM image of tooth shows scratches and marks on teeth, which indicate diet.

			Geometry of teeth also indicates diet

	Digestive systems
	-----------------
		Complexity of digestive system indicative of plant->meat->insect eaters.

	Noses and Smell
	---------------
		Strepsirrhines--Split nose, wet nose, likecats
					  --Jacobson's organ used to smell pheremones

		Haplorhines--dry nose, continuous upper lip and nose

	Ears and Hearing
	----------------
		3 parts--Outer, middle, inner-- function similar, structure can be different
	
	Reproductive Systems
	--------------------
		Pared testes, scrotum, size differs greatly, bacculum (penis bone)
		Paired ovaries, paired fallopian tube
			Uterus size depends on multiple/single birth
			Bicornate vs singular uterus
		Periodicity of reproduction quite variable
			Sexual selling

tl;dr: We can tell a lot about the ecological niche and behavior of an animal based on its anatomy, without observing the living creature.
