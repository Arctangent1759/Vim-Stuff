					We model the students as a directed graph of $n$ nodes, where $n$ is the number of students.
					Each "student" node points to exactly 1 other "student" node, and is pointed at by another "student" node.
					Hence, each node has an in-degree of 1, and an out-degree of 1.
					We will prove the assertion by showing by induction that this graph will always take the form of one or more unconnected cycles.\\
					\textbf{Base Case: } 
					$n=1$. The 1 student will get his own name. Hence, he will always point back at himself, forming 1 cycle.\\
					\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis: } 
					Assume that our graph always takes the form of 1 or more unconnected cycles for $n$ students.\\
					\textbf{Inductive Step: } 
					To construct the graph for $n+1$ students, simply add 1 student to a any of the graphs of $n$ students.
					By our inductive hypothesis, we already know that this graph consists of a positive number of unconnected cycles.
					By definition, each "student" must have an in-degree and an out-degree of 1.
					Our extra student is no exception.
					To add the extra student $S$ to the network, it is necessary to have $S$ point to another student, and have another student point to $S$.
					We divide this into two cases:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item
							S points to S.
							This means that S forms a cycle of length 1.
							The $n+1$ graph still consists of at least 1 unconnected cycles.
						\item
							$S$ points to a student $S'$ in a cycle.
							But there is only one slip of paper with $S'$'s name on it.
							If $S$  has $S'$'s name, the student $S*$ who had $S'$'s name in the $n$ configuration is now without a slip.
							Hence, this student must now have $S$'s name.
							While before we had $S*\rightarrow S'$, we now have $S*\rightarrow S \rightarrow S'$.
							We insert $S$ between $S*$ and $S'$ in the cycle.
							The $n+1$ graph still consists of at least 1 unconnected cycles.
					\end{enumerate}
					Hence, by induction, there will always be a way to arrange the students in a group in a cycle.

				$p=\frac{1}{n-k+1}\prod_{i=0}^{k-2} \frac{n-i-1}{n-i}=\frac{1}{n-k+1}\frac{n-1}{n}\frac{n-2}{n-1}\frac{n-3}{n-2}\frac{n-4}{n-3}\cdots\frac{n-k}{n-k+1}\frac{n-k+1}{n-k+2}=\boxed{\frac{1}{n}}$

			I would bet on the game, since over a large number of experiments, I would have a net gain in money.

			Yes. By simson's paradox, it is possible for this to happen.\\
			Suppose that the professor has 100 comedic shows, 90 of which are good.\\
			Suppose that the professor has 200 comedic movies, 10 of which are good.\\
			Suppose that the professor has 200 dramatic shows, 178 of which are good.\\
			Suppose that the professor has 100 dramatic movies, 1 of which are good.\\
			To summarize:\\
			\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
				\hline
				~     & Comedic               & Dramatic                \\ \hline
				Show  & $\frac{90}{100}=.90$  & $\frac{178}{200}=.89$   \\ 
				Movie & $\frac{10}{200}=.05$   & $\frac{1}{100}=.01$      \\ \hline
				Total & $\frac{100}{300}=.33$ & $\frac{179}{300}=.895$ \\
				\hline
			\end{tabular}\\
			As you can see, while the proportion of good comedic programs is higher than the proportion of good dramatic programs given that the program is a show or a movie, the proportion of good dramas is still higher than the proportion of good comedies.

			\textbf{Question:}\\
			Flip 3 unbalanced coins, with P(Head)=.3, P(Tail)=.7. Given that the first coin is a head, what is the probability that there are exactly 2 heads?\\
			\textbf{Solution:}\\
			$\binom{2}{1}\times P(Head)\times P(Tail)=(2)(.3)(.7)=\boxed{.42}$
