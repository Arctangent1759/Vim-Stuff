Primate Social Structures
=========================

How do you recognize kin?
-------------------------
+ Maternal kin - social learning
+ Paternal kin - Pheromones? Social learning? Temperment?

Hamiltons Rule
--------------
+ C < Br
+ C: Cost to actor
+ B: Benefit to recipient
+ r: coefficient of relatedness
    + How is r measured? Units?
+ More likely to do risky behavior for closely related kin
    + Alarm calls more common when more kin are near
+ Females do more altruistic acts in Matrilocal grous
+ If cost is low, likely to do altruistic act for ANY group member

                 | Benefits Recipient | Harms Recipient
-------------------------------------------------------
Benefits Donor   | Cooperation        | Selfish
-------------------------------------------------------
Harms Donor      | Altruism           | Spite

Recipricol Altruism
-------------------
+ Pay cost now, get benefit later (groom another group member instead of foraging)
+ Benefit must not exceed cost (mating opportunity, ally, food theft tolerance)
+ Individual recognition
+ Long time for interaction
+ Prisoners dilemma - who makes the first move?
    + Would increase the fitness of selfish individuals and decrease the fitness of altruistic ones
    + Selfishness --> Less altruistic actions in the future
+ Do primates act to preserve their genes, or do they act for the good of the group?


Primate Life History
====================

Background: Natural Selection
-----------------------------
+ Traits that increase survival/reproductive success are mantained
+ Traits that decrease survival/reproductive success are removed

Life History Theory
-------------------
+ Energy is finite
+ Getting mates, fighting infection, growing, reproducing all require energy
+ Optimal Life History is NOT maximal energy at each stage
+ Optimal Life History is overall fitness over entire lifespan
+ Energy is finite--leads to trade-offs
+ Get bigger or reproduce earlier?
+ Invest more on current or future offspring?
+ Grow or fight infection?
+ Primates spend an unusual proportion of lifetime spent in growth, and large newnatal brain size relative to body weight, and larger parental investment relative to other species

Life History and Behavior
-------------------------
+ Primates have longer gestation => slower prenatal growth
+ Primates have longer lactation => slower prenatal growth
+ Pelvic dimensions and neonatal head size
    + Most of our relatives have a much larger pelvis than neonatal head size
    + Humans have a much larger neonatal head than the pelvis, so we evolved birth rotation
+Lactation
    + Costs to mother
        + Tissue mass
        + Maternal fat gain
        + Fetal tissue
    + Milk composition is one component of a species lactation strategy:
        + Milk composition
        + Milk volume
        + Nursing frequency
        + Duration
    + Natural selection acts on strategies (like machine learning operates on policies?)
    + Determinants of lactation strategies
        + Rate and pattern of growth and development
        + Litter size
        + Parity (maternal age)
        + Offspring sex
    + Mother interests are not equal to offspring interests
    + Conflict of interests
    + Milk=compromise between mother and offspring interests
    + Human milk is mostly water, very dilute
    + Not enough data on primate milk to determine if human milk is unique
        + Milk composition different in wild and captive
        + Weaning is a process, not an event
    + Energy storage is larger in large animals than small ones
    + Primate milk is low fat, high sugar, low protein, low daily investment
    + Low "Quality" => Less vulnerable to fluctuating resources
    + Flexibility: able to employ mixed strategy (body stores, most energy intake, metabolic efficiency, less activity)
+ Life history shaped by environment and environment condition, Maternal condition, Maternal diet, ecology
+ In nonhuman apes, brain grows rapidly in utero
+ Humaan brain grows rapidly in utero and during first 12 months of life
+ When did this pattern emerge?
+ Do life history traits drive behavior, or do behaviors drive life history?
+ Behavior are hard to change
