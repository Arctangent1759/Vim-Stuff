Problem 4
---------
**You are given two boxes: one of them containing 900 red marbles and 100 blue marbles, the other one contains 500 red marbles and 500 blue marbles.**

Let $B$ be the event that a marble is blue, and $1$ be the event that a marble came from bucket 1.

1. **If we pick one of the boxes randomly, and pick a marble what is the probability that it is blue?**

2. **If we see that the marble is blue, what is the probability that it is chosen from box 1?**

    ![](http://tex.sh/$P(1|B)=\\frac{P(1\\cap B)}{P(B)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{20}}{\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{4}}=\\frac{1}{6}$.png)

3. **Suppose we pick one marble from box 1 and without looking at its color we put it side. Then we pick another marble from box 1. What is the probability that the second marble is blue?**

    ![](http://tex.sh/$\\frac{1}{10}\\times\\frac{99}{999}+\\frac{9}{10}\\times\\frac{100}{999}=\\frac{999}{9990}=\\frac{1}{10}$.png)
