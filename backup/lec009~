Even MOAR Frequency Response
============================
	Low pass filters
	----------------
		Let low frequencies pass, suppresses higher frequencies.

		The integral is an averaging operation. It is a low pass filter.
		Integral of 1/T from t-T to t x(s) ds depends on T.

		w >> 1/T filtered out.
		w << 1/T intact.

		Why?
			We are averaging over a window of (kt-T,T)
			A sinusoid that oscillates MANY TIMES over this window cancels out in the average.
			A sinusoid of low frequency over this window stays roughly the same in the average.

	Discrete Time
	-------------
		Discrete Time signals are limited by a maximum frequency.

		Discrete time frequency response is ALWAYS periodic, because frequency is limited.

Impulse Response
================
	An \*impulse\* is a signal \delta(n)={1 if n = 0, 0 otherwise}
	\delta ---------> LTI -----------> impulse response h(n)

	Impulse Response and Frequency Response are two sides of the same coin.

	Impulse response of the two channel echo system gets a pulse at t and a smaller one at t'>t.

	h(n)={1/2 if n=2, 1/4 if n=3, 0 else}
