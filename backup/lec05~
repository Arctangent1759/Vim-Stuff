Taxonomy
========

+ **Morphological species concept**--species defined base don morphological similarity
	+ Problem: species are often highly sexually dimorphic. Sexes can be misclassified as species, especially in fossils
+ **Biological Species Concept**--Based on Reproductive Isolation
	+ Most popular definition of species
	+ Two organisms are of different species if they cannot produce reproductively viable offspring
	+ Problem: Asexual species are hard to classify

How do new species arise?
-------------------------
+ Reproductive Barriers
	+ Physical barriers
	+ Ecological barriers
	+ Chemical barriers (different pheromones)
	+ Psychologial barriers
+ Theory of geographic (**allopatric**) speciation--is geographic isolation necessary?
+ Species are evolutionary accidents: there sisn't a purpose to fill up empty niches in nature
+ Speciation take a lot of time (100k to 1M years)
+ Is specation in the same place (**sympatric**) possible?
	+ Few and limited examples.

Methods of Classification
-------------------------

+ Taxon (pl. taa) = groups of organisms recognized as a formal unit in biological classification level
+ Classification is the rpocess of ordering organisms into groups or sets on the basis of their similarities or relationships that produces a heirarchy of classification
+ **Know the cladistic tree from the order up to the genus level**
+ Carolus Linneus created the Linnaean system
+ Wrote Systema Naturae - 1758
	+ Genus and species are italicized
	+ Species = genus + trivial name
	+ Sapiens = trivial name (not species)
	+ Most of Linneus's system has been replaced, but the tree system remains
	+ We still employ classification by structure and function (morphology)

###Homologous traits
+ Homologies are traits that imply common descent
+ Can be morphological
+ Can be genetic (hamming distance :P)
+ Homology

###Analogous traits
+ Only tells us function is the same
+ Solve the same problem, differ in structure
+ _Don't_ use to classify evolutionary relationships 
+ **Homoplasy**--Environment presents the same problem to different species, and some evolve similar structures to solve it
	+ Whale and shark tails
	+ Opossum and monkey tails


+ **Ancestral traits** are inherited by a group of organisms from a remote ancestor
+ Don't tell us anything about evolution after teh character evolved -- limited use
	+ Common organs, deciduous teeth, and placental birth help classify mammals
+ **Derived traits** are ancestral traits that are different from ancestral form

**Phrenetics**--based on similar characteristics
Phrenetics is based eon morphology, physiology, genes, but doesn't take into account evolutionary relationships

**Cladistics**--An approach that groups species on the basis of shared-derived characteristics
+ Cladistics are a way of lining up traits to identify close relatives both living nad extinct
+ Weighs all traits equally
+ Doesn't try to assess fitness
+ A clade is a group fo related taxa
+ Problem: Cladograms have no temporal element

**Phylogeny**--Cladogram with chronical framework. Takes into account when divergence happened
+ Before molecular methods, classification relied on morphology
+ Fallacy of phylogeny: large morphlogical differences imply large genetic differences
+ _Phylogenies and Cladograms are Hypotheses_
	+ Primate taxonomy is a dynamic field
	+ Molecules and morphology are used to classify
	+ Lumpers vs Splitters--how many taxa should there be?

Why mammals are classified by mammary glands
+ Mammals once classified by Linneus as quadripeds
+ Linneus changed the classification to mammary glands to encourage women to breastfeed

The Tarsier problem
-------------------
+ Tarsiers are classified as prosimians (like lemurs) rather than anthropoids because they are nocturnal.
+ **Tarsiers are classified as Haplorhini for the exam**

Review Problems
---------------
1. Defien and be able to provide examples of homologous traits, anaogous traits, and homoplasy
2. Why/how does homoplasy mess up the process of classification?
3. Why might classification based on morphology and molecular data differ?
