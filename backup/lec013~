Fourier Transform
=================
	x(n)=\sum_(k=0)^(p-1) X_k e^(ik\omega_0 n)

	Find the Fourier series of the impulse \sigma(n)={1, n=0; 0, n!=0}
	There is NO fourier series! Because the impulse is not periodic.

	To find the fourier series, consider p->\infinity.

	The fourier transform of a signal is:
		x(n)=\integral_0^(2\pi) X(\omega)e^(i\omega n) d\omega=1/(2\pi) \integral_(-\pi)^(\pi) X(\omega)e^(i\omega n) d\omega

		X(\omega) now measured in [unit]/(radian/sample)
	
	X(\omega) for the impulse is 1 \forall x.

	The impulse is a "white" signal, because it contains equal amount of signals at all frequencies.

	Y(\omega)=H(\omega)X(\omega), X and Y are the fourier transform coefficients of signals x and y, respectively.

	\_H(\omega) is the Fourier Transform of h(n)\_
