Emergence of early Anthropoids
==============================

Anthropoid Traits
-----------------
+ Larger brain and body
+ Reduced reliance on olfcation => shorter snout
+ More reliance on vision
+ Dirunal
+ Larger social groups => more sexual dimorphism

Fossil Anthropoids
------------------
+ Proteopithecus
    + Late eocene, fayum
    + Early anthropoid
    + Platyrrhine-like
    + 2.1.3.3 dental formula (Incisor, Canine, Premolar, Moldar
+ Catopithecus
    + Late eocene, fayum
    + Early anthropoid
    + 2.1.2.3 dental formula
    + Broad incisors
    + Frugivorous, insectivorous
    + Platyrrhine-like ear (ring, not tube)
    + Limb bones indicate arboreal quadruped
+ Aegyptopithecus
    + Oligocene, Fayum
    + Early anthropoid
    + 2.1.2.3 dental formula
    + Sexually dimorphic canines
    + Frugivorous
    + Platyrrrhine-like ear
    + Arm and leg bones indicate arboreal quadruped
    + Grasping foot
+ Eosimias
    + Mid-eocene, China
    + Early anthropoid?
    + Small body
    + Small incisors
    + Large canines
    + Diurnal?
    + Nocturnal?
    + LOOKS LIKE A KITTY!
+ Darwinius Masillae
    + Very well-preserved fossil
    + Herbivorous diet
    + Nocturnal? (large orbits)
    + Leaping
    + Similarity to lemurids, cebines, callitrichines
    + An adapoid that challenges placment of adapotds into Strepsirrine line
+ Early fossil finds seemed to point to a very platyrrhine-like ancestry for anthropoids
+ New fossil data suggest much more diversity in form
+ Platyrrhine-like forms were a later phenomenon of the Oligocene not present in Eocene deposits
+ Eocene anthropodis were smaller, broader ranger in diets
+ What is the sister taxon of anthropoids?
+ How did monkeys get to the Americas?
    + THEY BUILT BOATS AND SAILED TO AMERUKAH.
    + (They drifted there between islands on rafts. Maybe.)

Fossil Platyrrhines
-------------------
+ Dolichocebus
    + Early miocene, Argentina
    + Medium size
    + 3 premolars, 3 molars
    + Sexually dimorphic canines
    + Frugivorous
    + Arboreal quadruped 
+ Homunculus
    + Early-mid miocene
    + Medium size
    + 3 premolars, 3 molars
    + Likely sexual dimorphism in canines
    + Frugivorous/folivorous
    + Arboreal quadruped, leaping?
    + Smaller brain than extant platyrrhines
+ Protopithecus
    + Pleistocene, Brazil
    + Very large
    + Crani similar to howler monkey
    + Postcrania similar to spider monkey
+ Patagonian sub-group
    + Unusual mix of primitive nad derived traits
    + Phylogenetically confusing
    + Collateral to other platyrrine groups
    + Geographic isolation a possibility
    + Tropical parts of Central and South America

Living Platyrrhines
-------------------
+ 3 premolars
+ Rounded external nostrils (face laterally)
+ Different cranial structures (no ear tube, no frontal/sphenoid)
+ Largely arboreal living
+ Quadrupedal locomotion
+ No opposable thumb
+ Cebidae
    + Callitrichinae - marmosets, tamarins
    + Monogamous in captivity, highly variable in widkjo+ Postpartum ovulatino
    + Twinning (high predation risk?)
    + Cooperative care of young (alloparentating)
    + Claws instead of nails
    + Small body size
    + Some species specialized on gums/sap (exudites)
    + Also consume instects, fruits, fungus
    + Cebinae
        + Capuchin and squirrel monkeys
        + Cebus: 1-5kg
        + Limbs roughly
        + Limbs roughly equal length, prehenile tail
        + Second to humans in Encephilization Quotient
        + Long lived in captivity
        + Tool use
        + Eats small invertibrates
    + Aotinae
        + Owl/night monkeys
        + Largest orbit fo any monkey/ape
        + No tapetum lucidum, no color vision
        + Evolved from diurnal ancestors
        + Monogamous
        + Diet-frugivory/leaves
+ Family Pitheciidae
    + Pitheciinae
        +Sakis
    +Callicebinae -Titi monkeys
        + Males carry offspring
        + Females bigger than males
        + Offspring exhibit preferences for fathers, nto mohters
        + Pair Bonding (monogamous)
        _ Less spacialized than ukaris/ sakis
        + Leapers; mainly frugivorous (insects/leaves)
+ Family Alelidae
    + Atelidae -wooly monkeys, spider monkeys
    + Alouattinae - howlser (howling_ monkeys
    + True prehinsile tail
    + Frugivorous, high energy foods
    + In howler monkeys, both males and females leave native groups
    + Spider monkeys are sexually monomorphic, including sexual anatomy
