What is temperature?
====================
	Related to Entropy S:
	S=k_B ln(\Omega)

	Temperature is defined as:
	1/T=(\partial S)/(\partial E)

Proove k_B T=1/3 m <v^2>
========================
	Say you have 1 mole of gas in a cube.
	PV=k_B T

	Digression:
		<x> means average x.

	First calculate force exerted by a particle on a wall during collision.
	F = (\Delta p)/(\Delta t)=(2mv_x)/(2\ell/v_x)=mv_x^2/\ell
	P=<F>/A=(mv_x^2)/(\ell^3)
	k_B T=PV=m<v_x^2>

	<v^2>=<v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2>=<v_x^2>+<v_y^2>+<v_z^2>=3<v_x^2>
	(1/3)<v^2>=v_x

	k_B T=PV=(1/3)m<v^2>
