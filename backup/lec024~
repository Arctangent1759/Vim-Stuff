Sparsity
========
  Do compression to exploit sparsity.

  Collection-->Compression is inefficient. WWhy not just collect compressed data?
  
  Compressed Sensing
  ------------------
    If you throw away 66% of the samples of a waveform, you can still reconstruct the full signal with compressed sensing.
    Allows you to sample below the nyquist frequency

    Why?
    ----
      Our signals are finite.
      x(n)=\sum X_k e^(ikwn)
      w=2\pi/p
      x(n)=1/p \sum_(k=0)^(p-1) X_k e^(ikwn)

      x=[x(0),x(1),...,x(p-1)]
      X=[X_0,X_1,...,X_(p-1)]
      x=AX
      A_(nk)=1/p e^(ikwn)

      SOME OF THE FREQUENCY COMPONENTS BELOW NYQUIST ARE ZERO!!
      This means that signals are sparse. 

      Since some components are zero, can sample below nyquist
