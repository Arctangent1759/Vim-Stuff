*************************
Dont need to know all fossils in Fleagle, just the ones covered in lecture.
Focus on fleagle discussion sections where he contextualizes fossil record
Big picture, major issues in field.
*************************

Fossils
=======
+ Remains of organisms that are a result of slow replacement of organic material with rock-forming minerals
+ Bones/teeth
+ From the living, to the past
+ Fossils have to be either constantly wet or constantly dry
+ Body has to be covered relatively quickly, or it faces damage from scavengers
+ Deformation due to sediment pressures

Stratigraphy
============
+ Straitigraphy is the study of soil levels
+ Law of superposition - stuff closer to bottom is older, stuff closer to top is newer
+ Problems:
    + Materials often dip between layers
    + Have to match layers between levels

Dating Methods
==============
+ Relative Dating
    + Occurance of Y before X
    + Position in sequence
+ Absolute Dating
+ Chronometric dating (carbon-14, Potassium/argon, Uranium series dating)
    + Molecular Dating--dating based on changes in gene sequences

Why is the fossil record a total piece of shit?
===============================================
+ Continental drift
+ Changing environments
+ Depositional processes and taphonomy
+ Acidic soil and other geological problems
+ Under-studied areas

Anatomy Update
==============
+ Post-orbital bar--bar in front of eye--new world monkeys
+ Orbital closure--eye enclosed by bone--isolates it from chewing forces--old world monkeys
+ Ear bone in new world monkeys is loop, tube in old world monkeys

Mammals
=======
+ Eutherians
    + Very mature offspring
    + 2 sets of teeth, high metabolism
    + Large brains
+ Primate Origins
    + Early primates descended from tree shrews, flying lemurs, and maybe bats probably not

Plesiadapiforms
===============
    + Paleocene
    + North America and Europe primarily some in Asia
    + Highly successful
    + Significant diversity
    + No postorbital bar
    + Large incisors
    + Gap between ffront and back teeth called diastema
    + Small brains compared to prosimians
    + Purgatorious
        + Early paleocene found in Montana
        + Small mammal
        + Earliest plesiadapiform
    + Plesiadapis
        + Paleocene and early Eocene, North America and Europe
        + Back teeth like primate
        + Herbiorous
        + Long snout
        + Arboreal quadriped
        + Ear anatomy like living groups
    + Diverse group wit lots of cranail and post-cranial adaptations
    + Some insectivores, some folivores
    + Plesiadapis is too specialized to be a stem group for prosimians?
    + Purgatorious is generalized enough to be a LCA, but we know so little about it and it is so generalized that links are hard to establish
Eociene Primates
================
+ adapoids and Omomyoids
+ All features of living primates ( true primates) 
+ Reliance on vision
+ Claws to nails
+ Adapoinds
    + Lemur sized
    + Long broad snout
    + Post orbital bar
    + Considered a stem group of extent Strepsihrrines
Omomyoids
    + Omomyidae and Microchoeridae
    + Necrolemur; Tetonius
    + Small canines
    + Short snout
    + Huge eyes
    + Post-orbital bar
 Leaping but no clinging
