Dynamic and Disurptive Relationships among Pitheca
==================================================
Social Monogamy
---------------
+ Uncommon in mammals
    + We expect males to increase reproductive success by mating with many females
    + We expect females to increase reproductive success by investing into parental care
+ So why monogamy?
    + Parental care
    + Mate guarding
    + Joint defense of resources
    + Infanticide protection
    + Sakis exhibit non-traditional monogamy
        + Can occur in small multi-male/female groups
        + No pair-bond reinforcement behavior
        + No direct parental care
        + Sexually dimorphic and dichromatic

+ Multiple adult groups can form by retention of offspring or immigration

+ Biodiversity in Yasuni
    + 2274 species of trees
    + 567 species of birds
    + 105 species of ambphibians
    + 10 endangered primate species
