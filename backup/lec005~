Example Problem
===============
	Q: You have a speech singal x(t) over 100ms, with highest frequency component = 20kHz. How fast do you need to sample it?
	a)10kHz
	b)20kHz
	c)30kHz
	d)40kHz
	e)always lose info no matter how fast you sample it.


	CTFS (Continuous Time Fourier Series):
	--------------------------------------
		x(t)=A_0 + \sum_(k=1)^(p//2) cos(2\pi kf_ct+\phi_k)

		f_c=1/p=1/(.1s)=10Hz

		Highest Frequency: 20kHz

	DTFS (Discrete Time Fourier Series):
	------------------------------------
		x_d(n)=A_0+\sum_(k=1)^k A_k cos(2\pi kf_dn+\phi_k), n=0,1,...,p_d-1

		f_d=1/(p_d) samples^(-1), K=p_d//2

		f_c ----sample----> f_s 
		f_d=f_c/f_s


	f_c=10Hz
	f_d n = 20000=10K
	2000=K
	p_d=4000
	1/4000=(10)/x
	10/(x)=1/4000
	x/(10)=4000
	x=40000

	Therefore d.

	YOU DOUBLE THE SAMPLE FREQUENCY BECAUSE EACH SINUSOID HAS TWO UNKNOWNS--AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY.

Linear Time Invariant Signals
=============================
	Systems
	-------
		x(t)---------->System------------>y(t)

	Q: 1) Analysis: What happens to the frequency component of x(t) after passing through System?
	   2) Design: How do I design a system to give desired frequency properties of the output signal?

	x(t)=cos(\omega_0t+\phi)-->System-->y(t)=Acos(\omega t+\phi_2)
	x(t)=cos(\omega_0t+\phi)+cos(\omega_1t+\phi)-->System-->y(t)=A_0cos(\omega t+\phi_2)+A_1cos(\omega_0 t+\phi_0)
	y(t)=x(t-\tau(t))

	\*time-invariance\*  is the property of a system that its response to a signal does not depend on time.
