Mini-Biography:
==============
Classes can sometimes feel so impersonal!  We created this mini-bio so we may get to know each other a little better. 

This will be kept confidential amongst the staff, but you don't have to fill in anything you don't wish to.

** The staff will answer them too, so how about you? **
