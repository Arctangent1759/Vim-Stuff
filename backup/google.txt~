Most of my personal projects are written in Python or Go, while my larger scale or class projects tend to be written in Java. My other programming language proficiencies include JavaScript, C, C++, MIPS, Bash, LabVIEW, and Visual Basic.
My preferred development environment is vim, but am proficient with Eclipse, Netbeans, and Microsoft Visual Studio.
I tend to use frameworks like Node.js, Django, Flask, JQuery, and Phonegap for my projects.
