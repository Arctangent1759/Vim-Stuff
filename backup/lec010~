Moar Impulse Response
=====================
	To find the response to a given signal:
		1. Decompose the signal into pulses, x(t)\delta(n-t)
		2. Result at each n = x(t)h(n-t), t \in \integers
		3. Add the results together
	
	In summary:
		x(n)=\sum_(k=-\inf)^(\inf) x(k)\delta(n-k)
		y(n)=\sum_(k=-\inf)^(\inf) x(k)h(n-k)
		    =\sum_(k=-\inf)^(\inf) h(k)x(n-k)
		    =\sum_(k=-\inf)^(\inf) x(n-k)h(k)
	
	Notation:
		y = x * h, * is the \*convolution\* operator, which  gives you \_the sum of the effect of all the echoes\_.

	For negative values o k, you are summing over echoes from the future.
	A \*causal\* system is one in which the output at time n only depends on input values at times before n (no future echoes); h(k)=0 ffor k < 0.

	Q: ---->LTI_A---->LTI_B--->
		1) Is the overall system LTI?
			Yes
		2) What happens if I switch the order?
			Same
		3) Is the system causal if each system is causal?
			Yes

	Q: Which of the following are causal?)
		1) y(n)=1/2 [x(n)+x(n-1)]
			Causal.
		2) y(n)=1/3 [x(n+1)+x(n)+x(n-1)]
			Not Causal.
	
	\_Convolution is commutitive\_

	Only causal systems can be implemented in real time.
