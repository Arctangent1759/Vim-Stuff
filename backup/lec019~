Sampling
========

	Sampling bridges between continuous time and discrete time.

	--CT--> Sampling --DT--> Processing --DT-> Interpolation --CT-->

	Question:
		1.	Can I reconstruct the CT signals from the DT samples?
			Yes
		2.	How to reconstruct?
		3.	What happens when I cannot reconstruct?
			Aliasing
	
	Downsampling
	------------
		--DT--> Downsampling --DT-->

		Reduce the resolution of a signal without losing too much information.

	Aliasing occurs when frequency approaches f_s/2, known as the \*Nyquist Frequency\*.

	For a frequency above f_s/2, f = f_s-f_0, where f is the sampled frquency, and f_0 is the frequency of the source signal.

	Example:
		x(t)=cos(2 \pi f t)
		y(n)=x(nT)=cos(2 \pi fTn)
		1/T=f_s
	
	Mathematical reasoning for aliasing:
		u(t)=cos(2\pi (f+Nf_s)t), N is an integer
		v(n)=u(nT)=cos(2\pi (f+Nf_s)Tn)
		v(n)=cos(2 \pi (f+Nf_s)Tn)
		v(n)=cos(2 \pi f Tn + 2 \pi N f_s Tn)
		v(n)=cos(2 \pi f Tn + 2 \pi N n)
		v(n)=cos(2 \pi f Tn + 2 \pi N n)
		v(n)=cos(2 \pi f Tn)

		But what happens when you go past f_s/2?

		x(t)=cos(2 pi 7636 t)
		u(t)=cos(2 pi (7636-8000) t)
		u(t)=cos(2 pi (-364) t)
		u(t)=cos(2 pi (+364) t)
		u(t)=cos(2 pi 364 t)

	Frequency Domain Justification
		CTFTs are on -\infinity to \infinity
		DTFTs must be 2\pi periodic

		All frquencies above f_s/2 will alias.

		Solution: Remove high frequency with a low-pass filter and then sample (anti-aliasing)
