More sampling
=============
  How many samples do you need to reconstruct.

  2 f_max * p samples

  f_max=w/2

  W=f_max*2 (W is bandwidth of signal)
  # of samples = W*p = W*T

  Over [[0,p], x(t)=\sum_k=-infinity^infinity X_k e^(ikwt)
  w_0=2\pi / p
  k 2\pi/p =2\pi W/2
  k/p =W/2
  for negative freqencies, there are another Wp/2 term
  Number of terms Wp
  
  So the number of terms in the fourier series expansion of a signal is Wp

  There are Wp \*degrees of freedom\* for a signal with bandwidth W.

  So you only need a finite number of samples = Wp to represent a signal of bandwidth W and length p.

  Still off by a factor of 2, since X_k is complex.

  But if x is a real signal, X_ks are complex conjugates with X_(-k)

  So reduce terms by half. Everything agrees.

D/A and A/D
===========
  Contiuous Signal------>Sampler--------->Quantization--------->Bits

  We need quantization because amplitude is on \reals, while computers store things in bits.
  Need to quantize amplitude, so we can represent continuous amplitude with discrete amplitude.

  W=20kHz=>fs=2.0ksamples/s
  N=16 bits/sample
  R=320 kB/s

  Use statistical/probablistic compression to reduce data rate. (320 kb/s to 9.6kb/s)

Cell phone ODFM thing
=====================
  Continuous voice signal --sampler--> DT signal --quantization--> bits --compression--> less bits --Baseband DSP (IDFT)--> Discrete OFDM modulated signal --Reconstruction (D/A)--> Continuous ODFM modulated signal --multiply by cos(2 \pi f_c t)--> Passband signal --Sampling (A/D)--> Discrte ODFM with high frequency crap --Low Pass Filter--> Discrete OFDM without crap --Baseband DSP (DSP)--> bits

  D/A converter is nothing but an interpolation
    What kind of interpolation?
      Zero order hold? No. High frequency otside of bandwidth.
      Sinc? Yes.
      T=1/W s=.2 microseconds (ideal performance, use slightly higher T)

  How many bits can you send, given a certain bandwidth?
    Cannot send infinite signal because noise.
    Noise distorts signal.
