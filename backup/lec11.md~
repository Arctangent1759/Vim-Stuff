Primate Life History
====================
Infancy
-------
+ Primate infants are always in contact with mother
+ As infants age, space between tehm and mom increases
+ Key for socialization into the group
+ Able to observe and learn from mom and others
    + What to eat, how to eat it
        + Infants have smaller guts and mouths, missing full dentition, cant handle toxins well
        + Learning isnt always direct
        + Appply information gained at a later time
    + How to find food (foraging)
    + Who is kin
    + How to be an adult (social rules)
    + Tool use -- culturally transmitted behavior, mom to infant transmission may be crucial
    + Chimp infants watching others use tools understand how to use tools better
+ Infants can make calls, ned to learn when to make themand what they mean
+ Look to mom when hear alarm call, do what mom does
+ Better at making calls the more opportunities to hear them

Juveniles
---------
+ Importance of play?
    + Important in neurological development
    + More myelinated brains with more play
    + Play = more neural development
    + Assume results also true of primates
    + Practicing adult behavior, particularly male behavior -- Wrestle, chasing in males
    + Important for males who emigrate and males who stay in natal group
    + Play ramps up during juvenile period
+ It is hard and risky to be a juvenile
+ No more provisioning
+ Not adult size
+ Vulnerable to predators
+ Havent learned everything yet
+ Why prolong this stage?
+ Risks
    + Need high energy intake to grow quickly
    + Need to be an effective forager early in life
    + Cannot have lots of food competition
    + Risk starving before reproductive age
    + Lot of what you need to surviveand successfully reproduce requires learning (socially)
+ Juvenile Risk Aversion Hypothesis: Primates favor slow growth over rapid growth because they are
    + Less efficient foragers
    + More vulnerale to prediation
+ Social learning
    + Acqquisition of social skills led to lengthening of juvenile period
    + Better to learn when you are immature and nonthreatening to adult conspecifics
    + Length of juvneile period predicted to correlate with degree of social complexity (group size)
    + Relationship between size of neocortex and length of juvenile period

Social Structures
-----------------
+ Mate choice--Preferences, mating strategy
+ Tool use--Capability, Mostly females teaching, Culturally transmitted
+ Shared features of chimps and bonobos
    + LCA: 1-2mya
    + Locomotion = knuckle walking
    + Primarily frugivorous
    + Sexual dimorphism: Males bigger than females
    + Multi male, Multi female groups
    + Males are philopatric, females transfer at puberty
    + Differ in height
+ Differences between chimps and bonobos
    + Bonobos--black face
    + Chimps--pinkish faces
    + Chimps have more animal protein
    + Tool use more common in chimps
    + Chimps--male dominance, male/male coallitions, more aggression, more political
    + Bonobos: Feale dominance, related to ecology-less feeding competition, more food sharing and tolerance, non-reproductive copulation in lieu of aggression
+ Do non human primates serve as good models for human biology and behaviors?
    + Pros:
        + Best "model avaliable based on ancestry and genetics"
        + Most similar in biology
    + Cons:
        + Bonobos and chimpsa are not the last common ancestor
        + They have evolved since they shared last common ancestor with humans
        + Selective pressures on Pan may be very unique from those on hominids
        + Humans are "qualitatively" different?
    + What are some assumptions and inferences made about the last common ancestor?
        + Recent work by White, et al argues against this
    +Social system: Male Philopatry
        + Males bonded, females transfer
    + Diet -- Ommnivorous
    + Common assumption = LCA was more like chimpanzees
        + But bonobos are less studied
        + Recently, research has focused on bonobos as models
        + Fascination with their "make love, not war" approach
    + Bonobo facts
        + Why might cooperation among female bonobos evolve?
            + Artificial sisterhood -- Franz de Waal
                + Mantained by grooming and sexual contact
                + Females behave as if they were in a matrilineal group
                + Bonds between females lead to cooperation
                + Cooperation assists in female access to resources
                + May decrase inter-birth interval, age at first reproduction
        + Why engage in copulations when there is no chance of conception?
            + Evolved initially as paternity confusion, perhaps now has a new function
