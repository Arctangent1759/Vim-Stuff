The internet was once a localized service, a communications and information resource accessible only from computer terminals. The advent of the smartphone and other mobile devices changes this, changing the internet from an asset that is anchored to a computer to something you can hold in the palm of your hand. Now, with the boundless supply of personal data available on the web and the added dimensions of location and portability afforded by mobile technology, it is possible not only to better connect the world and foster communication, but also to create community.
Imagine a public place, full of strangers, people who would normally be without reason to reach out to one another. Normally, these people would continue to go about their business in isolation. Now, suppose that there were a web service, or a mobile app, that would scrape the public online profiles of these individuals, and bring together those with sufficiently similar interests and aspirations. Such a simple application would have the potential to bring together study groups, business partners, lovers, who would normally never meet. In place of the organic means of friend-finding and connection-building, in which people meet, discuss their interests, and reiterate until they find a suitable match, our application would quickly build communities based on the personality profiles freely available online. As such, mobile technology can not only create a more open and connected world, but also build community in an otherwise isolated social sphere.
