Cenozoic Time Scale
===================
+ Pleistocene
+ Pliocene
+ Miocene
    + Earliest hominids
    + Pongis - Great Apes
+ Oligocene
+ Eocene
+ Paleocene

Africa
======
Proconsul Heseloni
------------------
+ Early miocene, Africa
+ 2.1.2.3 dental formula
+ Frugivorous
+ Large snout
+ Robust zygomatic arches
+ Bony ear tube
+ No tail
+ Elbow articulation
+ Ulna/carpal articulation and monkey-like vertebrae
+ Probably arboreal quadruped
+ Sexual dimorphism

Europe
======
+ Elbow morphology of apes, logn curved digits, derived vertebral morphology
+ Similarity of living ape anatomy and locomotion
+ Combination of traits varies between genera and species, suggesting varied forms of locomotion

Pliopithecoidea
---------------
+ Related to the propliopithecoids from egypt and probably some proconsuloids from sub-saharan arica
+ Originally thought to be fossil gibbons
+ Now considered stem catarrhines (lack ear structure of crown catarrhines)
+ Arrived firstin Europe but lived alongside Hominoidea

Pierolapithecus Catalunicus
---------------------------
+ Middle miocene, Europe
+ Flat face
+ Thick enamel
+ Suspensory?
+ Flexible writst
+ Wide ribcage
+ Scapula on back
+ Transitional vertebrae
+ Fingers straight => not suspensory?
+ Possible ancestor of all great apes, or just african great apes?
+ Dryopithecus
+ Late miocene, europe
+ More gracile than other Eurasian apes

Dryopithecus
------------
+ Late miocene, Europe
+ More gracile than other Eurasian apes
+ 2.1.2.3 dental ormula
+ Thin enamel
+ Frugivorous
+ More ape-like postcrania than proconsul
+ Relationship with living great apes debated


Asia
====
Sivapithecus
------------
+ Late miocene, asia
+ Diet of hard nuts, fruit, bark?
+ Crania = similar to living orangutans
+ Concave face
+ Projecting incisors
+ Tall orbits, close together
+ But postcrania suggests non-suspensory locomotion
    + Quadrupedal? Climbing?
+ Related to orangutans

Gigantopithecus
---------------
+ Late Miocene to Pleistocene, Asia
+ 2 species
+ Extremely large
+ Thick enamel, low cusps, vary robust mandible... grinding
+ Bamboo eating spcialization?
+ Likely terrestrial
+ Related to living orangutans
