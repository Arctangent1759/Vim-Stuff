Recap: Aliasing
===============
	f_s (Hz) sampling rate

	Q: Under what condition on x(t) is reconstruciton possible?
		on X(w)
		Cannot reconstruct if there are two frequencies that are an integer multiple of f_s apart, 
		since they produce the same discrete time samples.
	
		x(t)=A cos (2 pi f t) + B cos (2 pi (f + fs) t)
		y(t)=(A+B) cos(2 pi f T_n t), T = simple interval

		Cannot reconstruct, because y(t) has one sinusoidal component of amplitude (A+B); it is impossible to extract the (f+fs) frequency.

		If there is no aliasing (all nonzero frequency components occur between -fs/2 and fs/2), then reconstruction is possible.
		This is because no two nonzero frequency componenets are more than fs apart.
		You can even shift the signal or width fs, and still reconstruct because of conjugate symmetry.
	
	Apply Ideal Low Pass Filter to prevent aliasing. Known as the \*Anti-Aliasing Filter\*.

	Impulse response of Ideal Low Pass Filter:
		h(t)=1/(2 pi) \integral_-\inf^\inf H(w) e^(iwt) dw
		h(t)=1/(2 pi) \integral_(-w/2)^(w/2) 1 e^(iwt) dw = (sin wt) / (wt)
