Fossil Colobines and Cercopithecines
====================================
Fossil Cercopithecines
----------------------
-Macaques:
    -Various Macaca species
        -Africa: Late miocene
        -Europe: Early Pliocene
        -Asia: Late Pliocnene
-Mangabeys
    -Parapapio
        -Late Miocene-early Pleistocene, Africa
        -Near the ancestry of baboons and mangabeys
        -Size between mangabes and savannah baboons
        -Little sexual dimorphism
-Baboons
    -Various Papio species
        -Africa: Pliocene through Pleistocene
            -Highly debated classification
    -Guenons
        -Possible teeht?
            -Late pliocene-pleistocene
            -Limited fossil record in East and South Africa

Fossil Colobines
----------------
-Mesopitehcus
    -Late miocene-pliocene
    -Folivorous
    -Short face
    -Narrow nasal opening
    -Sexually dimorphic
    -Arboreal quadruped?
- Cercopithecoides
    -Pliocene-Pleistocene, Africa
    -Larger than living colobines
    -Soter but grittier diet than living colobines
    -Limited sexual dimorphism
    -Terrestrial

Final Points
------------
-Old World Monkey record differs from that of apes
-Apes-abundant record from early and middle miocene, fade off in late miocene
-OWM-very little until Miocene, thene xplosion of fossils
-Most apes extinct, living groups less diverse
-OWM living groups more diverse and fossil groups link up nicely with living species
-Why? --Ecological replacement and climate change

Living Old World Monkeys
========================

Superfamily Cercopithecoidea
----------------------------
Subfamily Cercopithecenes
-------------------------
- Features set them apart from other apes
- Bilophodont molars (2 ridges)
- Polygynous
- More folivorous than new world monkeys
- Quadrupedal - terrestrial/arboreal
    - Limbs of rougly equal length
    - Small differences between the 2 subfamilies
    - Colobines: longer hindlimbs (more equal in cercopithecines) -more leaping
- Cheek puches--evolved since 2 subfamilies shared common ancestor about 10mya
- Storage of fodd - related to competition/group size?
- Storage of food - related to competition/group size?
- Food digestion? Break down starches, role in seed dispersal?
- Ischial callosities - Thickened, specialized skin
- Sleeping adaptation?
- Sitting on thin branches
- Vary in size accross Cercopithecines
- Subfamily Macaca
- Next to Homo, most widely distributed primate genus
- Percent of time in trees varies
- Multi-mmale, multi-female  group
- Female philopatry--kin bonding, daughters get rank from mothers
- Males leave natal group, migrate many times over lifetime
- Male reproductive success related to rank
-Genus Papio
    - Diet: omnivorous, opportunistic
    - Fruit, flowers, seeds, leaves, gums, underground storage organs, vertibrates, insects, shellfish, garbage, occasionally flamingoes o_o
    - Diet of human food --> obesity and diabetes
    - Home range and daily path length get bigger with less resource avaliability
    - Male dominance
    - Some groups within troops are harems - one male, many females
    - Others are multi-male
- Mangabeys
- Mandrills / Drills
    - Very large, west and central africa
    - Baboons? Or related to cercocebus?
    - Sexual dimorphism extreme, males 3 times bigger than females
    - Terrestrial quadruped
    - Diet: Fruit, seeds, nuts, insects

Subfamily Colobinae
-------------------
- "Leaf eating monkeys"
- Not all exclusively folivorous
- Multichambered stomach and fermenting bacterai
- Break down toxins in leaves
- More arboreal than cercopithecenes
- 2 main groups: 
    - colobini from africa (bolobus monkeys)
    - Prebytini
