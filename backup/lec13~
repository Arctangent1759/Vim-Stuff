Multilevel Caches
=================
  Adding more levels of caches drops the miss penalty significantly.

  If miss L1, search L2.
  If hit L2, move to L1.

  AMAT = L1 HT + L1MR * L1MP
  L(m)P = L(m+1) HT + L(m+1)MR * L(m+1)MP

  1+.02*(5+.05*100)

Local miss rate: fraction of references to one level of a cache that miss
Global miss rate: product of all miss rates

AMAT=L1HT+L1MR*L2HT+MRGlobal*L2MP

CPI:
CPI_stall=CPI_base+(Accesses/Instr)(L1MR*L1*MR+MRGlobal*L2MP)

L1 focuses on low hit time (fast access)
