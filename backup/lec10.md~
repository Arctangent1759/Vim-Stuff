Communication
=============

- Can be influenced by a number off factors
- Ecology/Habitat
    - Structure
    - Predation
- Four main components
    - Signal
        - Vocalizations, facial expressions, body postures, odors, tastes, sexual dimorphism, touch
        - Failing to recognize signals can have costly consequences
    - Motivation
        - The internal state of the actor who is sending the signal
        - What states may motivate an animal to signal?
        - Not conscious, has to be infered in the wild
    - Meaning
        - Refers to the message that is recieved by the recipient of a signal
        - May be context specific or depend on the actor or the recipient
        - Same message may be recieved differently by two ore more individuals
        - Same message may be recieved differently by the same individual if contexts are different
            - Age (social age?)
            - History of contact
            - Ranking or position
            - Kin or non-kin
    - Function
        - It is an adaptive advantage
        - Avoid costly interactions through ritualized behaviors
        - Physical modes of communication are under selective pressures (reduuced competition)
- Are monkey vocalizations learned? (Is there a window?)
- Squirrel monkeys - isolated individuals make "normal" sounds; suggests making the sound is not learned
- But the meaning of the sound appears to be learned
- Velvet monkey infants give caution calls for all things of a similar class, get more specific as socialized
- Velvet infants look to mother hwen they hear alarm clal, react as mother reacts
- Evidence thatexperience is related to sign/interpreting signals
- Frequency of exposure matters
- Why are there so many forms of communication among primates?
- Prerequisite for maintaining fthe complex social lives that primates lead
- Co-Evolution of primate communication and primate sociality
- Tactile Communication
    - Mother-infant
    - Play behavior
    - Touching "games of trust", eg male baboons
    - Hugging
    - Grooming
    - Premating tactile communication
- Visual communication
    - Primates have enhanced visual acuiry
    - Body postures used by all primates
    - Facial signals largely restricted to monkeys and apes. Why not Strepsirrhines?
    - Eyes and brows very important in many species
    - Mouth less ambiguous
    - Primates vary in their ability to "read" and send visual signals
- Olfactory and gustatory
    - Odors are generally volatile fatty acids produced by bacteria, secreted from glands
    - Pheromones signal female reproductive condition, age, sex, identity
    - "Scent trails" (slow loris)
    - Can elicit resposne in brain
    - Used for scent marking boundaries territory
    - Urine washing; social (territory, fertility), but also protective against toxic plants
    - Female presentation of genitals to males
    - Difficult to distinguish Gustatatory and Olfactory
    - Volatile compounds stimulate nose, soluable compounds stimulate taste
- Vocal communication
    - Do group dialects exist?
        -Chimps and pant-hoots-specific to groups
    - Evidence of dialects
    - Chimps who spend a lot of time together make similar sounds
    - Why is vocal communication important?
    - "Long calls": gibbons, orangutans, ring-tailed lemmurs, howler monkeys
    - Lower frequency sounds related to density of forest, low frequency sounds travel farther than high frequency sounds; less affected by distorting, scattering, degredation by foliage
    - Time of day, travel farther inmorning, less humid
- Human language is Voluntary, Learned, Symbolic
- Animal sounds  are Reflexive, Genetically Determined, Affective
- Non-human primates do not possess the anoatomy (tongue and larynx in right position) to form sounds that make up language
- Primates are unable to produce human sounds
- Many humans cannot speak, but they have language
- Language is: 
    - Syntax: How words form an idea
    - Symbolic: Meaning of word not determined by its sounds, shared meaning
    - Openness: Ability to communicate about totally new things nad ideas
    - Discreteness: Spoken words are distinct from others in the same phrase
    - Displacement Talking beyond events are here and now
- Apes have been trained to sue symbols and do sign language
