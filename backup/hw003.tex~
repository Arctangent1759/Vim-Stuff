					But $3\times3^{2^{n+1}}>3^{2^{n+1}}$\\
					Since $3\times3^{2^{n+1}}>3^{2^{n+1}}$, our proof is not suffficiently strong; it does not hold for values in $(3^{2^{n+1}},3\times3^{2^{n+1}})$

					This implies that our Inductive Hypothesis here is stronger than the statement we are trying to prove.\\
					$\implies a_{n+1}\le3^{2^{n+1}}$\\
					$a_n\le 3^{2^{n}}$
					Since we proved that $a_{n} \le 3^{2^{n+1}-1} < 3^{2^{n+1}}$, a statement stronger than the original statement, we have also proved that the original statement holds.

					Suppose, for contradiction, that two men M an M' are matched with the same woman W in the final pairing $P_f$.\\
					By the algorithm description, $\exists$ a stable pairing $P_1$ in which M is paired with W and M' is matched with W*, and $P_2$ in which M' is paired with W and M is matched with W**.\\
					But since M and M' are both matched to W, M' prefers W to W*, and M prefers W to W**.\\
					By definition, W either has preferences M $>$ M' or M' $>$ M. There are, hence two cases:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item
							\textbf{Claim: }If W likes M $>$ M', then (M, W) is a rogue couple in $P_2$.\\
							W prefers M to her current partner M'.\\
							M prefers W to his current partner W**\\
							Hence, (M,W) is a rougue couple in $P_2$.
						\item
							\textbf{Claim: }If W likes M' $>$ M, then (M', W) is a rogue couple in $P_1$.\\
							W prefers M' to her current partner M.\\
							M' prefers W to his current partner W*\\
							Hence, (M',W) is a rougue couple in $P_1$.
					\end{enumerate}
					By case, if $P_1$ is stable $\implies$ $P_2$ is not stable. If $P_2$ is stable $\implies$ $P_1$ is not stable. Contradiction.
				\item
					Suppose, for contradiction, that the pairing $P_f$ produced by the algorithm is not stable $\implies \exists $ a rogue couple (M,W) in $P_f$.\\
					Then, M is paired with some W' < W, and W is paired with some M' $<$ M.\\
					But if M is paired with W', $\exists$ a stable pairing $P_1$ in which M is paired with W'.\\
					But M prefers W to W'. $\implies P_1$ cannot be stable, because (M,W) forms a rogue couple in $P_1$.\\
					By definition of the Mr. Matchmaker's algorithm, $P_1$ must be stable. Contradiction.
				\item
					Suppose, for contradiction, that $\exists$ a woman W who gets her favorite suitor M $\ge$ M', where M and M' are her suitors.\\
					This implies that M picks W$\ge$W', where W and W' are both his suitors.\\
					Since M can choose between W and W' and W has suitors M and M', there must exist stable pairing $P_1$ in which M is matched with W, and $P_2$ in which M is matched with W' and M' is matched with W.\\
					\textbf{Claim:} $P_2$ is not stable.\\
					M prefers W to W'.\\
					W prefers M to M'.\\
					If M is matched with W' and W is matched with M', (M,W) forms a rougue couple in $P_2$. Contradiction.
				\item
					Suppose that there are $n$ stable configurations in the space of all stable configurations.\\
					Apply the Matchmaker Algorithm to the first two configurations.
					Then, apply the algorithm to the result and the next configuration, and apply the algorithm to the result and the next configuration thereafter until all configurations are exhausted.\\
					For example, there are configurations 1,2,3,4, and 5. Let M(x,y) be applying the Matchmaker Algorithm to pairings x and y.
					The result of the aforthmentioned operation is M(M(M(M(1,2),3),4),5).\\
					By 3.3, $P_{12}$ M(1,2) will result in each woman W getting the worst suitor of their suitors in 1 and 2.
					But $P_{123}$=M($P_{12}$,3) will result in each woman W getting the worst suitor of their suitors in $P_{12}$ and 3.
					By extension, we can justify the lemma that pessimality is transitive.\\
					Now, let us consider the $n$ stable configurations in the space of all stable configurations. 
					With each iteration of the Matchmaker Algorithm, each woman will get her worst suitor of the suitors presented to her, by 3.3.
					But by definition, each woman's pessimal mate is unique.
					Hence, when the Matchmaker Algorithm is applied down all the possible stable configurations, each woman will end up with her pessimal suitor.
					Because female pessimality implies male optimality, there always exists a male-optimal, female-pessimal configuration.

					This problem is just the standard propose and reject algorithm with special assumptions about the preference lists.
					Each man $M_n$ has an imaginary friend, $W^I_n$. Let $W^I_n$ always have $M_n$ at the top of her preference list.
					$M_n$ prefers some number of real women, then $W^I_n$, then some number of real women, and then all other imaginary women.
					Likewise, each woman $W_i$ has an imaginary friend, $M^I_i$. Let $M^I_i$ always have $W_n$ at the top of her preference list.
					$W_n$ prefers some number of real men, then $M^I_i$, then some number of real men, and then all other imaginary men.\\
					Now suppose that there is a couple (M,W) in pairing P generated by this algorithm, where M or W may or may not be imaginary.
					Suppose that M prefers W* (imaginary or not) to W. Then W* > W in the list of M, so M must have proposed to her first.
					So if M is paired with W, W* must have rejected M in favor of M', so W* prefers M' to M.
					Hence, there exists no rougue couple in P.
				\item
					Let S(x) be a function that denotes stability of a couple x, $[P \rightarrow T,F]$, where P is a pairing configuration, and T,F is true or false.
					Let M(x,y) denote taking the Matchmaker Algorithm of pairing configurations A,B, $[P^2 \rightarrow P]$.\\
					Let A and B be pairing configurations.
					$S(A) \wedge S(B) \Rightarrow S(M(A,B))$, by definition of the Matchmaker Algorithm.
					Hence, $\neg S(M(A,B)) \Rightarrow \neg S(A) \vee \neg S(B)$. \\
					\textbf{Approach: }One just have to prove $\neg S(M(A,B))$ for $A$ a pairing where man M is single, and $B$ a pairing where M is married to W. (Since the number of single men and women is always equal, our logic applies reflexatively to women as well).\\
					\\
					Supppose for contradiction that $\exists$ two stable pairings, A in which M is single, and B in which M is married.
					There are two cases:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item
							\textbf{Man m prefers being single to being married.}\\
							In pairing A, man M is paired with S, his imaginary mate. In other words, he is single.
							In pairing B, man M is paired a woman W < S. 
							It becomes clear that B is unstable; M likes S more than W, and by definition, M is at the top of S's list. (M,S) forms a rogue couple in B.
							Contradiction.
						\item
							\textbf{Man m prefers being married to W to being single.}\\
							In pairing A, M is paired with S, is imaginary mate. In other words, he is single.\\
							Some man M' is paired with W.
							Some other man M* is paired with W'.\\
							In pairing B, M is paired with W > S. 
							M' is paired with W'. 
							M* is paired with S, and is single. (the number of single men must remain constant)\\
							In order for these pairings to be stable, the following preferences must be true:
							M: W $>$ S, by the assumption of this case\\
							M*: W' $>$ S, for A to be stable given B is stable\\
							M': W' $>$ W, for B to be stable given A is stable\\
							W: M' $>$ M, for A to be stable given B is stable\\
							W': M* $>$ M', for A to be stable given B is stable.\\
							Hence, M(A,B), the application of the Matchmaker Algorithm will be:\\
							M is paired with W
							W' is paired with W'
							M* is also paired with W'.
							But in 3.1 we proved that the Matchmaker Algorithm will never pair two men to a single women. No stable version of M(A,B) exists. A or B must be unstable. \\
							Contradiction.
					\end{enumerate}
					By contradiction, if a man or woman is single in one pairing, he or she is single in all pairings.
