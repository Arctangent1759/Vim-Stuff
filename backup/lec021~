More Sampling
=============
  Under what conditions can we reconstruct the continuous signal?
    f_s=sampling frequency
    T=1/f_s
    f_(max)<=f_s/2
  If we can reconstruct, how?
    Interpolate between known points.
  What can go wrong?
    Aliasing

Interpolation
=============
  Zero-order hold:
    Take each point (n,f(n)), and set all values in [n,n+1) to be f(n).
    Bad. Nature is continuous.

  Linear Inerpolation:
    Straight line between each point.
    Bad. Nature is smooth.

  (Interpolation in time domain is pretty useless.)

  Use frequency domain.

  -x(t)-> sampler -y(n)-> interpolator -z(t)->

  x(w) in rads/s
  y(w) in rads/sample
  z(w) in rads/s

  Each w in discrete time frequency domain maps to wf_s+nf_s, n \in \integers
  
  Y(w)=f_s \sum_k=-\inf^inf X(wf_s+k(2\pi)f_s)

  z(t)=\sum y(n)h(t-nT)

  Z(w)=fourierTransform(z(t))=\sum_(n=-inf)^(inf) y(n) e&(-iwnT) H(w)
