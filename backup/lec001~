						Signals

#########################################################

EE20 discusses *signals* and devices that collect and process them.

Signals
=======

Types of signals:
	-temperature
	-radio frequencies
	-sound
		-varies over time
	-acceleration
	-orientation
	-image
		-varies over space
	-video
		-varies over space and time
	-touch
	-gps

A signal is a quantity that varies over time and/or space and carries information.
Mathematically: A signal is a function

Systems:
========
*Systems are ALSO functions! The DOMAIN of a system is the space of all valid signals.*

Input signal > |System| > Output signal

Example: Smartphone Camera Noise Removal:
Shitty Video Signal > |Vibration Compensation| > Smoother Video > |Compression| > Fewer Bits > |Modulation (Allows signal to be sent over the air)| > Modulated Signal sent by antenna > |*multi-path channel*| > |Demodulation| > etc.

Used for:
	-Signal Processing
	-Communication
	-Control
			--->System-------

			----Controller<--

Sense, communicate, and control

Frequency Domain representation
===============================
Different ways to represent signals

Signals can be represented as *a linear combination of sinusoids*
	-Sinusoids have constant frequencies
	-Useful because FREQUENCIES have INHERENT PHYSICAL MEANING
