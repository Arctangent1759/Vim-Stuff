Primate Teeth
-------------
+ Usually unspecialized teeth
+ Four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars
+ Multiple **dental formulas**

Primate Diets
-------------
+ All primates eat a variety of foods, but most primates emphasize certain foods
+ Diet types
	+ Insectivory
		+ Insectivory: a diet emphasizing insects
		+ Often nocturnal, solitary foraging
		+ Traits: simple digestive tract (insects easy to digest)
		+ Sharp tooth cusps (to break insect shells)
	+ Gummivory
		+ Diet emphasizes tree gums
		+ Traits--simple digestive tract
		+ Shortupper incisor
		+ Dental comb
		+ Claws
	+ Folivory
		+ Diet emphasizing leaves and other plant parts
		+ Complex digestive tract
		+ Small incisors
		+ Molar shearing crests
		+ Robust mandible and cranial features
	+ Frugivory
		+ A diet emphasizing fruit
		+ Intermediate digestive tract
		+ Broad incisors
		+ Low, rounded molar cusps
+ Jarman-Bell Principle
	+ Large animals require large amounts of nutrition, but small nutrient requirement relative to weight (low energy).
	+ Small animals require small foods with large amounts of energy (high quality).
	+ Hence, larger animals tend to have bigger guts and eat leaves
	+ Insectivore species < Folivore species
	+ Frugivore species + insects < Frugivore species + leaves
+ Overview of nutrients
	+ Carbohydrates
		+ Monosaccharides are simple
		+ Disaccharides are lightly less simple
		+ Polysaccharides are complicated and hard to digest
		+ Sources
			+ Fruit Pulp (calories, easy to digest)
			+ Tree Gum (calories, hard to digest)
			+ Leaves/Bark (hard to digest)
	+ Proteins
		+ Amino Acid Chains (9 amino acids that must come from diet)
		+ Primates need more amino acids than other mammals
		+ Sources
			+ Leaves (young > old)
			+ Insects
			+ Pollen
			+ Animal tissue
			+ Fruit pulp (not that much)
	+Lipids
		+ Best source of energy
		+ Used for absorption of minerals
		+ Sources
			+ Leaves
			+ Fruit
			+ Seeds/nuts
			+ Eggs
			+ Algae, fish, shellfish
			+ Brains, Marrow, eggs
	+ Vitamins
		+ Geophagy--eating dirt and clay to gain microvitamins
	+ Fruits vs Leaves
		+ More leaves, but fruits provide more energy for less digestion
+ How do primates figure out what to eat?
	+ Primates form a sensory map using its senses
	+ Touch: Softer food is higher in nutrition
	+ Hearing: 
		+ Direct: used to locate prey
		+ Indirect: Food calls
	+ Smell
		+ Short range sense, except for lorisids and other Strepsirrhines
		+ Used to tell ripeness
	+ Sight
		+ Trichomatic vision for rgb
		+ Possible explanations:
			+ Coevolution with angiosperms
			+ Leaf Eating: red leaves are younger--easier to digest and higher in protein
			+ Less olfactory cues to leaf maturity
+ Locomotion
	+ Primate locomotion varies depending on
		+ Habitat
		+ Diet and Ecology
		+ Body size
		+ Evolutionary history
	+ Vertical clinging and leaping
		+ Practiced by prosimianslike Lemurs and Lorises
		+Traits
			+ Long legs and feet
			+ Relatively small body size
	+ Quadrupedal Locomotion
		+ Arboreal
			+ Legs longer than arms
			+ Long tails for balance
		+ Terrestrial
			+ Equal arms and legs, more grasping
			+ Shorter tails
	+ Branchiation
		+ Arm over arm swinging
		+ Apes (especially lesser apes)
		+ Long arms, ong, curved fingers
		+ Scapula on back of ribcage
	+ Semi-branchiation
		+ Suspending from tree branches with help of prehensile tail
		+ Some new world monkeys
	+ Knuckle walking
		+ Walking on knuckles of hands
		+ Chimps and gorillas
		+ Arms longer than legs
		+ Long, curved fingers
